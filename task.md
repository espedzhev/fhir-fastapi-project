# Backend Engineer - Technical Assessment
Our tech teams are curious, driven, intelligent, pragmatic, collaborative and open-minded and you should be too.

## Testing Goals
We are interested to see how you approach a problem, which involves designing and building an application that's underpinned by good software engineering practises. You will need to use your intellect, creativity, judgement and be comfortable making decisions to produce a solution. Your solution does not need to be a complete applications but should demonstrate you understand how to build software with good software engineering practises.

You will have approximately 1 week to review these details and reach out to the recruiter to inform them that you would like to schedule a second round interview  

We are keen to see what ideas, technologies and approaches, you would take went presented with an open ended problem

## The Task
Reviewing the requirements and coming up with a solution, and able to walk through steps and tools involved in building a healthcare API that could be used to provide patients care record to a healthcare application.
Then explain how you might break it into tasks, which could share to a team of developers 

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task and should focus on an MVP but you are free to take this as far as you wish.

## Requirements
The designs need to include the following:

- **API** That can access to the data stored in the json file, and provide it to a UI in a responsive way


## Context
[FHIR](/https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a popular standard within healthcare used by healthcare systems to exchange data and represent details of patients in a standardised way. Some sample FHIR data has been generated in the data directory using a tool called [synthea](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html). 

As FHIR is a standard there may be many libraries and UI widgets you can use freely. Google is your friend.

## Evaluation
We take into account 5 areas when evaluating a solution. Each criteria is evaluated from 0 (non-existent) to 5 (excellent) and your final score would be a simple average across all 5 areas. These are:

- Functionality: Performance and structure of solution?
- Good Practices: What are the good coding standard that we should be following?
- Testing: Test to carry out to ensure code is working as expected.
- Maintainability: Ensuring the solution is easy to run and update
- Task definition: What level of details are needed to communicate the steps of the task to other team members? 

## Reviewing your solution	
The second round interview we work as whiteboarding session, where we can go through your thoughts and designs for the above test
